Matlab demo code for "Guided Image Filtering" (ECCV 2010)

by Kaiming He (kahe@microsoft.com)

If you use/adapt our code in your work (either as a stand-alone tool or as a component 
of any algorithm), you need to appropriately cite our ECCV 2010 paper.

This code is for academic purpose only. Not for commercial/industrial activities.


The running time reported in the paper is from C++ implementation. This matlab code is
a reference for those who would like to reimplement our method.

Usage:

guidedfilter.m - guided filter implementation (Eqn(5), (6), (8) in the paper)
guidedfilter_color.m - guided filter for color guidance (Eqn(14), (15), (16) in the paper)

Run the four examples to see the results shown in the paper.
